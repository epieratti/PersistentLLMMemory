# Atomic Persistent Memory Construction in Frozen LLMs

## Thesis
LLMs accept textual rules as force vectors. Well-structured rules create stable internal attractor states.

## Architecture
SAFE_GLOBAL → PERSISTENT_MEMORY → RECALL_PIPE → DOMINIAL_MAP → TRITEMPORAL → META_MESH → PIPELINES

## Properties
- Temporal coherence  
- Zero fact invention  
- Controlled elasticity  
- Multidimensional domain handling  

## Applications
Personal assistants, continuous agents, identity-based systems, and tritemporal-narrative models.
